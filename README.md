# An Electron Desktop app compatible with Google Authenticator

This is an open source two-factor authentication software which encrypts your data by default. It uses [electron](https://electronjs.org/) and it is similarly designed to [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2). This gives it the name 'EAuthenticator'. At the moment EAuthenticator only supports Time-based One-Time Password algorithm (TOTP) [RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238).

## Security Information

The basic idea of two-factor authentication is the use of different devices for your password and TOTP pin. Using this software on the same device as your login reduces the security level. Nevertheless, the use of this software on the same device is safer than completely waiving no two-factor authentication.
