This is an open source two-factor authentication software which encrypts your data by default. It uses electron and it is similarly designed to Google Authenticator. This gives it the name 'EAuthenticator'. At the moment EAuthenticator only supports Time-based One-Time Password algorithm (TOTP) [RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238).
