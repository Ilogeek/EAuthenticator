# An Electron Desktop app compatible with Google Authenticator

![Eauthenticator Logo](/img/title.png)

This is an open source two-factor authentication software which encrypts your data by default. It uses [electron](https://electronjs.org/) and it is similarly designed to [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2). This gives it the name 'EAuthenticator'. At the moment EAuthenticator only supports Time-based One-Time Password algorithm (TOTP) [RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238).
